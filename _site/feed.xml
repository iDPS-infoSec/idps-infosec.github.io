I have a solid background in penetration testing and am looking to transition into the red team field.</p>

<p>Currently, I have taken a few red team courses and will continue learning and applying what Iâ€™ve learned.</p>

<h2 id="current-study-plan">Current Study Plan</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Initial Access</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Review <strong>Red Team Initial Access</strong> with Michael Allen. I took this training at WWHF Mile High earlier in the year and will go through the recordings and labs again.</li>
      <li>Review <strong>Arsenal Assembly: Creating Red Team Infrastructure</strong> from SAINTCON to revisit setting up EC2 redirectors and general infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Malware Development and EDR Evasion</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Finish <strong>Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester (OSEP/PEN-300)</strong> to strengthen EDR evasion skills and reinforce Active Directory attacks.</li>
      <li>Continue working through <strong>MalDev Academy</strong>, getting hands-on practice writing exploit code to bypass detection.</li>
      <li>Complete <strong>Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)</strong> for training material and Cobalt Strike practice.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>C2 Infrastructure</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Hands-on practice with <strong>Sliver</strong> and <strong>Cobalt Strike</strong> frameworks. Build a basic C2 server to understand how they work.</li>
      <li>Create <strong>Beacon Object Files (BOFs)</strong> and practice OPSEC to blend into environments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A lot of the learning will overlap, and the plan may change as I discover new material. I will emphasize hands-on practice and set up <strong>practice environments in my home lab Proxmox server</strong>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The goal of this blog is to document my learning as I explore different offensive security topics, primarily red teaming and purple teaming.
