    The goal of this blog is to document my learning as I explore different offensive security topics, primarily <strong>red teaming</strong> and <strong>purple teaming</strong>. I have a solid background in penetration testing and am looking to transition into the red team field.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
    Currently, I have taken a few red team courses and will continue learning and applying what I’ve learned.

<h2>Current Study Plan</h2>

<h3>1. Initial Access</h3>
<ul style="line-height: 1.6;">
  <li>Review <strong>Red Team Initial Access</strong> with Michael Allen. I took this training at WWHF Mile High earlier in the year and will revisit the recordings and labs.</li>
  <li>Review <strong>Arsenal Assembly: Creating Red Team Infrastructure</strong> from SAINTCON to revisit setting up EC2 redirectors and general infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Malware Development and EDR Evasion</h3>
<ul style="line-height: 1.6;">
  <li>Finish <strong>OSEP/PEN-300</strong> to strengthen EDR evasion skills and reinforce Active Directory attacks.</li>
  <li>Continue working through <strong>MalDev Academy</strong>, getting hands-on practice writing exploit code to bypass detection.</li>
  <li>Complete <strong>Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)</strong> for all training material and Cobalt Strike practice.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. C2 Infrastructure</h3>
<ul style="line-height: 1.6;">
  <li>Hands-on practice with <strong>Sliver</strong> and <strong>Cobalt Strike</strong> frameworks. Build a basic C2 server to understand how they work.</li>
  <li>Create <strong>Beacon Object Files (BOFs)</strong> and practice proper OPSEC to blend into environments.</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin-top: 2rem; line-height: 1.6;">
  <p>A lot of the learning will overlap, and the plan may change as I discover new material. I will emphasize <strong>hands-on practice</strong> and set up <strong>practice environments in my home lab Proxmox server</strong>.</p>
