The goal of this blog is to document my learning as I explore different offensive security topics, primarily red teaming and purple teaming. I have a solid background in penetration testing and am looking to transition into the red team field.  

Currently, I have taken a few red team courses and am looking to continue learning and apply what I have learned.

## Current Study Plan

1. **Initial Access**
   - Review **Red Team Initial Access** with Michael Allen course. Earlier in the year I took this training at WWHF Mile High and will be going back through the recording and labs.
   - Review **Arsenal Assembly: Creating Red Team Infrastructure** course I took at SAINTCON to revisit setting up EC2 redirectors and general infrastructure.

2. **Malware Development and EDR Evasion**
   - Finish **Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester (OSEP/PEN-300)** to gain a solid foundation in EDR evasion and reinforce AD attacks.
   - Continue working through **MalDev Academy**, getting hands-on practice writing exploit code to bypass detection.
   - Sign up and complete **Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)** for all the training material and Cobalt Strike practice.

3. **C2 Infrastructure**
   - Hands-on practice with C2 frameworks such as **Sliver** and **Cobalt Strike**. Build a basic C2 server to better understand how they work.
   - Make **Beacon Object Files (BOFs)** and practice good OPSEC to blend into the environment.

A lot of the learning will overlap, and the plan might change as I find different material. I will be placing a heavy emphasis on hands-on practice and will set up **practice environments in my home lab Proxmox server**.
