The goal of this blog is to document my learning as I explore different offensive security topics, primarily **red teaming** and **purple teaming**. I have a solid background in penetration testing and am looking to transition into the red team field.

Currently, I have taken a few red team courses and will continue learning and applying what Iâ€™ve learned.

## Current Study Plan

1. **Initial Access**
   - Review **Red Team Initial Access** with Michael Allen. I took this training at WWHF Mile High earlier in the year and will go through the recordings and labs again.
   - Review **Arsenal Assembly: Creating Red Team Infrastructure** from SAINTCON to revisit setting up EC2 redirectors and general infrastructure.

2. **Malware Development and EDR Evasion**
   - Finish **Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester (OSEP/PEN-300)** to strengthen EDR evasion skills and reinforce Active Directory attacks.
   - Continue working through **MalDev Academy**, getting hands-on practice writing exploit code to bypass detection.
   - Complete **Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)** for training material and Cobalt Strike practice.

3. **C2 Infrastructure**
   - Hands-on practice with **Sliver** and **Cobalt Strike** frameworks. Build a basic C2 server to understand how they work.
   - Create **Beacon Object Files (BOFs)** and practice OPSEC to blend into environments.

A lot of the learning will overlap, and the plan may change as I discover new material. I will emphasize hands-on practice and set up **practice environments in my home lab Proxmox server**.
